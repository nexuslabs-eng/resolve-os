// Deleting the user cascades away their own Membership rows automatically
// (Membership.user has onDelete: Cascade), but NOT the Organization itself,
// which has no cascade path from User — so any organization this user was
// the sole member of would otherwise be left behind forever. This finds
// those "about to be orphaned" organizations before the delete happens
// (their membership rows won't exist to check afterward), then removes
// them too, once the user itself is gone.
